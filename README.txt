To run the program, type:

`python max_spread.py weather.dat`

Assumptions:

- Only the first 3 columns in the data file are relevant to the problem

- The first two lines and the last line in the file can be safely ignored

- If the maximum spread appears in two or more days, the first one found will
  be returned
